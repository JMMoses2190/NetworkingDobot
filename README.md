# NetworkingDobot
### Using an Arduino MEGA with an Ethernet Shield, we were able to control to a Dobot arm over the internet.
#### We took an open source file, for controlling the Dobot with the Arduino and then used the Arduino to run a website that users could pick which command they wish the Dobot to execute from just a web browser.
##### Instructions:
###### Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE and then push the files to the Arduino. Unplug the Arduino from the computer and then turn on the Dobot, the lights on the Arduino Board will flash and then you will be able to connect to the IP address of the website
