# NetworkingDobot
Using an Arduino with an Ethernet Shield, we were able to control to a Dobot arm over the internet.
We took an open source file, for controlling the Dobot with the Arduino and then used the Arduino to run a website that users could pick which command they wish the Dobot to execute from just a web browser.
